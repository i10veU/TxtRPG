// V2-Core-22: the first real V2 world data pack (docs/v2/architecture/
// CORE_CONTRACTS.md §11, Issue #74). A small "frontier village" scenario
// built entirely from already-implemented Condition/Effect/Resolvable/
// Growth/Relation/Rumor/Fact mechanics -- no new engine semantics were
// invented to build this content (see D-65 for the one genuine contract/
// code gap this pack deliberately works around instead of relying on).
//
// Minimal playable loop (canonical path, V2-Core-29/30 -- each step happens
// where it makes sense, enforced by `location` and `rumor` Conditions):
//   village: observe (grow `investigation` proficiency)
//   -> village: talk to the elder (a real `choice`: ask about the ruins, which
//      teaches the `rum_ruins_secret` rumor, or just small talk)
//   -> market: buy a lantern (spends money, gates the ruins link)
//   -> ruins: investigate -- only once the rumor is known (a real check()
//      against `wit`, decided by RNG); a success confirms the rumor from a
//      second, first-hand source; the ruins hazard costs HP on arrival and
//      again while you stay
//   -> village: rest (the recovery action)
//   -> village: talk to the elder again; once the investigation is confirmed a
//      third option appears -- report what you found (optional, V2-Core-31)
//   -> enough accumulated investigation unlocks `unl_keen_eye`, which
//      together with what the investigation confirmed gates a final
//      confrontation action (a second check(), tags:["social"]); if you
//      reported to the elder, the village stands behind you and the leader is
//      shaken further, and the bandits as a group are cowed
//   -> village: talk to the elder once more; a confrontation the village stood
//      behind opens one more option -- leave the bandits' fate to the elder
//   -> market (any later step): once the bandits are cowed and the leader is no
//      longer one of them, the merchants show their relief -- once
//   -> village, any character, any time later: the elder can be asked for news of
//      the bandits once the village's history says they dispersed
//   (reporting to the elder and confronting the leader take the character's own proof
//   -- the relic only their own successful investigation yields -- not the world's flag)
//
// V2-Core-25 wires already-implemented mechanics into this same pack (no new
// engine semantics): `minutes` on the two long actions, `location`-gated
// village activities, one `data.events` hazard at the ruins whose `hp`
// Effect can kill the player, and `rules.succession` for the replacement
// character. See CORE_CONTRACTS.md D-66's follow-up note.
//
// V2-Core-29 again adds no engine semantics: `act_buy_lantern` (market) and
// `act_investigate_ruins` (ruins) are now location-gated with the same
// `location` Condition, and `act_rest_village` heals through the existing `hp`
// Effect. `version` stays "0.1.0" on purpose: the change adds one action and
// restricts where two run, with no state-shape change, so saves made before it
// stay valid (D-68 leaves bumping to the pack author).
//
// V2-Core-30 also adds no engine semantics: `act_investigate_ruins` now needs
// the elder's rumor (the existing `rumor` Condition, allowed in player context
// -- only `fact` is restricted, §8.4) and its success re-learns that rumor in
// observe mode (existing `rumor` Effect: the claim is copied from the fact the
// investigation just set, from the new source `obs_loc_ruins`). No
// `data.rules.rumor` gains are set: nothing reads confidence, so the
// confirmation shows up as `confirmations`/`sources` only. `version` stays
// "0.1.0" for the same reason as above (no state-shape change; D-68).
//
// V2-Core-31 also adds no engine semantics: a third elder option is gated by the
// confirmed-investigation flag (choice-option `requires`, the existing `flag`
// Condition) and writes the elder's relation edge (existing `relation` Effect:
// score, mode and a `confidant` tag); the confrontation's success outcome reads
// that edge with the existing `relation` Condition inside an `if` Effect. The tag,
// not the score, is what counts: talking to the elder is free and repeatable, so a
// score threshold could be farmed without ever learning anything. `act_confront_
// leader`'s own requirements and its check are unchanged. `version` stays "0.1.0"
// (no state-shape change; D-68).
//
// V2-Core-32 also adds no engine semantics: the same backed branch now writes the
// bandit organisation's edge towards the player (`org_bandits` -> self, a `cowed`
// tag -- organisations are ordinary relation edge ends, told apart from NPCs only
// by their ID prefix, §7.1), and a fourth elder option reads it, together with the
// leader's `member` tag that the investigation wrote, with the existing `relation`
// Condition; using it removes that membership (`untag`), so the option closes itself.
// Nothing changes for a player who never reported: the unbacked confrontation is
// exactly what it was. `data.events` could read the same edges (a trigger sees a
// same-step tag change) but nothing here needs an event. `version` stays "0.1.0"
// (no state-shape change; D-68).
//
// V2-Core-33 also adds no engine semantics: that result now outlives the moment it
// was made. `evt_market_reopens` (a `data.events` entry, `once`) reads the same two
// edges -- the bandits are cowed and the leader is no longer a member -- and fires in
// whichever later step the player is standing in the market. Nothing decays those
// edges (there are no relation rules), so the event sees them however much time and
// travel has passed; `state.fired` keeps it from paying twice. The `cowed` edge is
// the acting character's (`org_bandits` -> `player_<n>`): a successor does not inherit
// it, and the event is simply false for them. `version` stays "0.1.0" (no state-shape
// change; D-68).
//
// V2-Core-34 also adds no engine semantics; it draws the line between what belongs to
// a character and what belongs to the world (CORE_CONTRACTS D-70). `state.actors[id]`
// (items, money, hp, growth), `state.knowledge[id]` and every relation edge that has a
// `player_<n>` at one end belong to that character; `flags`, `cases`, `facts`, `fired`,
// `time` and the edges between world entities belong to the world, and a successor
// inherits none of the first kind (`rules.succession` above is the only bridge, and it
// grants money only). `opt_ask_bandit_news` reads nothing but the second kind -- the
// `ruins_mystery` case is resolved and the leader is no longer a member -- so it is
// offered to whoever is asking, the acting character or their successor, and to nobody
// on any other history. What a successor should inherit, and who a world-level reward
// belongs to, are design decisions this pack does not make. `version` stays "0.1.0"
// (no state-shape change; D-68).
//
// V2-Core-35 also adds no engine semantics; it fixes one mismatch V2-Core-34 recorded.
// `flags` are world-unit (§4.1: no subject), yet the report option and the confrontation
// read `ruins_secret_confirmed` as if the CHARACTER had confirmed the secret, so a successor
// who never investigated could report and confront. Both now require `item_relic`
// (`item` Condition, character-anchored): only a successful investigation writes it, into
// the investigating character's own inventory, so a successor has none until they earn one,
// and a failed investigation leaves none. The flag is still written -- it is the world's
// record that the secret was confirmed -- it just no longer stands in for a character's own
// proof. The rumor's confidence was the other candidate marker and was rejected: it needs a
// `data.rules.rumor` gain, and a save made before the change (already at confidence 60 with
// its observe source recorded) could then never reach the threshold. The relic is already in
// such a save, so nobody is stranded. `version` stays "0.1.0" (no state-shape change; D-68).
//
// V2-Core-44 also adds no engine semantics; it applies the human decision on D-71 (3): a world
// edge the story has settled is not reversed by a character's later action. `act_investigate_ruins`
// can be repeated, and its success wrote the leader's `member` tag every time -- so investigating
// again after `opt_bandits_disperse` brought the dispersed gang back (the elder's news stopped, the
// market's relief became false, the dispersal reopened), for the same character and for a successor.
// The membership is now written only while `case_ruins_mystery` is unresolved (an `if` Effect in
// the same position, so every earlier path keeps its events); the dispersal is only reachable after
// the case is resolved. A save already in the revived state is not repaired (no migration).
// `version` stays "0.1.0" (no state-shape change; D-68).
//
// This is deliberately small (Ponytail): one data module, one growth
// system, three locations, two NPCs (referenced only as relation/rumor
// participant IDs -- see D-65, no `state.actors` records for them; a full
// NPC actor/scheduler is explicitly out of scope per Issue #74).
